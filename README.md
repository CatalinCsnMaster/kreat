## Directory structure

* `/src` contains the source code of your Vendure server. All your custom code and plugins should reside here.
* `/static` contains static (non-code) files such as assets (e.g. uploaded images) and email templates.

## Development

```
yarn start
# or
npm run start

## Migrations

[Migrations] allow safe updates to the database schema.

The following npm scripts can be used to generate migrations:

```
yarn migration:generate [name]
# or
npm run migration:generate [name]
```

run any pending migrations that have been generated:

```
yarn migration:run
# or
npm run migration:run
```

and revert the most recently-applied migration:

```
yarn migration:revert
# or
npm run migration:revert
```
